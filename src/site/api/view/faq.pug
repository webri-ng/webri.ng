		a(href='#what')
			h2 What is this site?
		p
			| Webri.ng is a platform where people can host 
			a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring') webrings
			|  without the need to manage their own infrastructure.
		p
			| This platform was created as a tribute to the internet's early days, which we believe was
			| a cultural renaissance, where an emergent culture of creativity blossomed.
		p
			| We hope that this platform empowers people to be creative, and recapture the
			| feelings of creative freedom, and freedom of expression that defined the internet of yesterday.

		a(href='#customise')
			h2 Can I customise my webring?
		p
			| The idea behind this service is to provide the functionality a user would need to 
			| run their own webring. Webri.ng doesn't intend to offer a fully-featured hosting
			| service. The ideal use case is the owner of a webring sharing the links provided 
			| to allow users to navigate their webring.
		p
			| This can be used in a variety of ways, such as embedding the links in a 'badge' 
			| format that the members of a webring can place on their pages. Or perhaps embedding 
			| the links in images. In many cases, only using the 'random' link will suffice.
		p
			| Users are always free to set up DNS records so that they can embed the links to 
			| their webring into their site. Such as redirecting their own URLs to the 'next', 'previous',
			| and 'random' links associated with their site. These URLs are permanent, and do not change.
		p
			| If you need assistance with using your webring, feel free to 
			a(href='/contact') reach out
			| .

		a(href='#content')
			h2 What kind of content is allowed on this service?
		p
			| The owners of webri.ng strongly believe that the internet should be a place where 
			| people from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, religions, ethnicities, 
			| sexual orientations, and political beliefs can freely and safely express themselves.
		p
			| So far we have not had to specify any concrete rules about what kind of content
			| people are allowed to link to on this service, and we would like to keep it that way.
			| Having said this, we reserve the right to remove any content that we think 
			| is offensive to the general public, or brings the service into disrepute.
		p
			| While we acknowledge that the decentralised nature of the internet does 
			| create a 'grey area' with regards to the specific legality of content,
			| this site is hosted in the United States of America, and as such, we are 
			| bound to comply with US law.
			| The owners of this service are also bound to comply with the laws of the countries we reside in.
		p
			| We do not specifically prohibit content of a sexual nature, 
			| provided that this content would be legal in the United States. 
			| However, if you do wish to run webrings with links to sexual content, 
			| we kindly request that you set these webrings to 'private', 
			| so they do not appear in the main index.
		p
			| We do not 
			i want
			|  to prohibit political content, however due to its 
			| potentially divisive nature we kindly request that webrings
			| dedicated to political issues are set as 'private'.
		p
			| If you have any questions about our content policies, please 
			a(href='/contact') get in touch
			| .

		a(href='#source')
			h2 Is the source code to this service available?
		p
			| Yes it is! The source code for this site can be viewed 
			a(href='https://github.com/webri-ng/webri.ng') here
			| .

		a(href='#selfhost')
			h2 Why not provide users software for self-hosting?
		p 
			| That's a good question! I did considering creating software for users 
			| to self-host their own webring instance. This is totally in alignment 
			| with this website's aims of supporting the 'small web'. 
		p 
			| In the end I decided to create the service you see here today. 
			| If for no other reason than to take advantage of the great URL! As a compromise, the 
			| source code for this site is fully available. If you want to fork this site's 
			| software, and use it to create your own webring software, that's totally fine! 
			| Provided you give proper credit of course.

		a(href='#remove_my_site')
			h2 A user of this service has added my site to their webring, and I'd like it removed.
		p 
			| If you'd your site removed from a webring, 
			| the first thing to do is to contact its owner.
			| If you don't know how to contact the owner, 
			| check to see if their contact details are included in their webring's profile on our platform.
			| If you can't contact the webring's owner, 
			| or the webring owner is uncooperative, please 
			a(href='/contact') get in touch
			|  with us, and we'll look into it.

		a(href='#design')
			h2 What's up with the layout? Why's the design so basic?
		p 
			| The design of this site is a tribute to the 
			a(href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org' target='_blank') golden age of web design
			| , heavily inspired by classic web 2.0 websites like 
			a(href='https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/web-design-history/deviantart-2000' target='_blank') DeviantArt
			| , and 
			a(href='https://www.esreality.com/' target='_blank') esreality
			| .
			| The design is intended to remind users of the internet's early days,
			| when websites were much more personal, and webrings were more common.
			| A consequence of this minimal design is that the website is lightweight,
			| and loads quickly on most devices.
		p 
			| If you have any suggestions for how we can improve the design, please 
			a(href='/contact') get in touch
			| !
			| You're also always welcome to directly suggest any changes in code,
			| by raising a pull request on our 
			a(href='https://github.com/webri-ng/webri.ng' target='_blank') Github page
